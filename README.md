## About BRFSS

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the nationâ€™s premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. Established in 1984 with 15 states, BRFSS now collects data in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories. BRFSS completes more than 400,000 adult interviews each year, making it the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world.

By collecting behavioral health risk data at the state and local level, BRFSS has become a powerful tool for targeting and building health promotion activities. As a result, BRFSS users have increasingly demanded more data and asked for more questions on the survey. Currently, there is a wide sponsorship of the BRFSS survey, including most divisions of the CDC and many other federal, state, and local agencies.

## Project Overview

### Objective

This project aims to develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a respondent having diabetes using the BRFSS dataset. By analyzing various health indicators and demographic variables, I aim to identify key risk factors and develop a reliable predictive model for diabetes.

### Key Variables Considered

- **Demographic factors**: Age, Sex, Race, Education Level
- **Health status**: General health, Physical health, Mental health, Body Mass Index (BMI)
- **Lifestyle behaviors**: Smoking status, Exercise frequency, Alcohol consumption
- **Medical history**: History of depressive disorder, prediabetes, insulin use, heart disease, stroke
- **Access to healthcare**: Frequency of doctor visits, ability to afford medical care

### Goal

To provide healthcare professionals and policymakers with a tool that can identify individuals at higher risk of diabetes, enabling targeted interventions and health promotion activities aimed at preventing the onset and managing the progression of diabetes.

### Impact

By accurately predicting the likelihood of diabetes, my model can assist in:
- Early identification of high-risk individuals
- Improved allocation of healthcare resources
- Development of personalized prevention and management strategies
- Reduction in the prevalence and burden of diabetes at the state and national level

## Methodology

I will develop the predictive model using machine learning techniques, employing a training dataset of BRFSS responses to build and validate the model. The performance of the model will be evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.

Through this approach, I aim to harness the power of BRFSS data to contribute to better health outcomes and more effective public health strategies in the fight against diabetes.

## Python Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Data Loading

The BRFSS dataset is loaded and preprocessed to handle missing values, categorical variables, and normalization as needed.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the Jupyter notebook to see the analysis and model development steps.

## Results

The final predictive model will be presented along with its performance metrics, insights derived from the data analysis, and recommendations for healthcare interventions based on the findings.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of using large-scale health survey data to predict and manage chronic health conditions like diabetes, ultimately contributing to better public health outcomes.
